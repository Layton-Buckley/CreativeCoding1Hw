Final Project Description:
For my final project I want to create an audio visualizer for a song I have written, recorded, and produced. 
The scene of the vizualizer will be a stage with shapes resembling instruments that are featured in the before mentioned song.
Ex. A stage with two guitars on each side, a drum set in the middle, and a microphone and bass guitar on each side of the drumset.
Each corrisponding instrument will react ONLY to audio of the instrument it is corresponding to. Ex. Guitar will only react to the guitar waveforms, vocals only to vocal waveforms etc. 

Expected problems:
For this to be possible, I have to find out how to make custom shapes wthin p5js. Not only that, I also have to figure out how to make said
shapes react to the audio in the first place.
I also need to find how to implement the instruments responding to ONLY the corresponding waveforms.
My idea for this issue, is to take my project file of the song and render out the individual instruments of the song. I will then do the 
necessary coding in order for the insruments to respond to their correct waveforms.

Work Plan:
Hope to have most, if not all, instruments designed and placed in the scene by the end of Saturday April 26th Also have the individual song
parts rendered

Begin the "audio coding" portion by Monday April 28th. Finish the "audio coding" by the end of Friday May 2nd.

Take the rest of the time until the final is due to add any finishing touches/fix any bugs

Work Done so far:
Began researching creating custom shapes within p5js. Also researched how to make shapes represent audio sources to create the vizualizer.
