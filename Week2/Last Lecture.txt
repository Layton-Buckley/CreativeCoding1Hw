The Last Lecture was a very thought-provoking lecture about how to lead a life and achieve one's goals and dreams. Randy discussed several intriguing topics, ranging from overcoming obstacles to Death and Morality. He also gave some great advice. Randy has many thought-provoking quotes throughout this lecture, but one that stood out to me was, “Experience is what you get when you didn’t get what you wanted.” This just stuck out to me because I haven’t thought about it that way before, and I will try to implement that in my thinking moving forward. Randy often used the analogy of a brick wall. Randy says that brick walls aren't there to stop us but to test how badly we want what we are trying to achieve. I identify with this very strongly. Again, it was something that I hadn’t thought about in that particular way before, but it makes total sense. Every time I’ve hit a “brick wall” in the past, I’ve always gotten frustrated and discouraged,d but after seeing it in a different light I think I can now see it as a motivation.
