Learning styles have always been a complicated subject for me. I’ve always thought that learning styles exist and that not everyone learns the same way. However, I’ve recently seen research and other papers or lectures disproving learning styles alongside this class, which has thrown a wrench into how I’ve looked at learning my whole life. I’ve never really been able to absorb anything a teacher says in any lectures that I’ve been in, so I’ve always had to do work on my own to try and teach it to myself, which I don’t know what style that would fall under but it's just something I’ve always had to do. Just from my experience, I would say that they do exist, and they can affect how some people learn, but it’s something that I would have to look into and think about more.
