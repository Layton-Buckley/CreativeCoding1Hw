	CLI and GUI are very different forms of interfaces. Let's start with CLI. CLI is a text-based interface that allows you to type commands in a terminal to interact with a computer or code in general. It gives you greater control over what is happening, but it is often seen as intimidating and not very user-friendly. CLI can also be faster, as it costs less system resources to run. There are also no menus, graphics, or pointing devices such as a computer mouse when using CLI. It can also allow multitasking to work in a CLI environment, but it can also be disorienting and confusing to see so many things on one screen.
	A GUI is much more beginner-friendly and user-friendly in general. Its appearance can be easily modified or changed to be more understandable or organized. A GUI can also allow information to be displayed in many formats, such as text, videos, images, and more. GUI also allows autocorrect to help avoid spelling or grammar mistakes. But GUI’s aren't perfect. They use more system resources, causing them to be slower and consume more memory. GUI also doesn’t allow you to script a series of commands or events. GUI also needs both a keyboard and a mouse to function.
